This Style Guide is based off Bootstrap 4.0 Alpha as of (5/2017). The concept is that we will reuse the `_variables` from Bootstrap as a _base_ for all variables to keep things consistent.

The idea is that if you changed your `_theme.scss` in your `static/scss` folder, this should inherit the themes from it so you can visually see all of the changes.

## Custom Variables or Components

Well, the idea that you would add your custom components as you go into this styleguide as documentation. We don't want every little thing to be documented, but something weird and complex that you probably want to add such as maybe a custom Modal box or grid.
