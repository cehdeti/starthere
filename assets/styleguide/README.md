# Style Guide Overview

## Setup

1. Make sure you're inside the `styleguide` folder 
2. `bundle install`
3. Start up jekyll: `jekyll serve --watch` (Couldn't get it work with a gulp task, TOFIX item)
3. `gulp styleguide:watch` to watch all of the sass changes (as well as the root's `_theme`)
3. `gulp styleguide` to just build the styleguide

Please run the styleguide to see the rest of the docs.
